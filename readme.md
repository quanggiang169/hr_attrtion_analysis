# HR Attrition Analysis and Insights

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition to identify the key factors influencing attrition. I used **R** to explore the dataset and uncover important relationships and factors associated with employee attrition. The insights were visualized using **Tableau**, providing clear and interactive dashboards for better understanding.

## Objective
- Identify factors contributing to employee attrition.
- Provide actionable insights to improve retention rates and overall employee satisfaction.

## Data Source
This project uses a fictional dataset from the [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) available on Kaggle. The dataset contains employee information such as demographic details, job roles, satisfaction scores, and attrition status.

**Note**: The dataset is synthetic and does not represent real-world employee data. It is intended solely for educational and analytical purposes.

## Tools and Technologies
- **R**: For exploratory data analysis (EDA) and identifying key attrition factors.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **GitHub**: For project collaboration and version control.
